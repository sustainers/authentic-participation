****************
High-level recap
****************

This discussion took place across two working sessions at `Sustain 2020 <https://blog.jwf.io/2020/02/sustain-oss-2020-quick-rewind/>`_:

- Models for corporate accountability as open source community members (a.k.a. what does it mean to be a corporate member of open source communities?)
- Principles of Authentic Contribution (`session notes`_)

Across the sessions, we talked about the following:

#. Organizational accountability
#. How to participate in open source transparency and authentically as an organization
#. Desire to create an inter-organizational resource to take back to our orgs to help explain what authentic participating in open source actually looks like
#. Explore ways to build social accountability into our workplaces

Themes from Sustain conversations
=================================

The `session notes`_ are annotated and color-coded according to the following themes:

- **Maintainer responsibility**: Open-sourcing your own projects or participating in existing communities
- **Guiding hand**: Navigating contribution intent with a hidden agenda that is not well-communicated
- **Participation**: Making key decisions while involving a community
- **Equalizing knowledge**: Understated value in documentation?
- **Undervaluation of open source**: Communicating less obvious perks for engaging authentically
- **You and corporation**: Relationship between individual contributors and the organization they represent in their contributions
